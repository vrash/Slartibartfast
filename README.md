### About me
The name is <b>Irde</b>. {Dramatic pause} <b>Vrashabh Irde</b>. :) 

I have more than 10 years of desktop/backend/mobile programming of which about 4 years managing other people like me. 
I've worked at small and large companies before, but I am really enjoying working with challenges that come with growing at scale. I've learnt more from failure (stint at ImagineK12 (Now a part of Y-Combinator)), than I have from success. But, I have found my calling in being an engineering leader of people for the last 4 years.

I am currently a senior [engineering manager](https://medium.com/carwow-product-engineering/the-engineering-manager-readme-a0d398f46e82) at [carwow](www.carwow.co.uk), a tech startup in London. I moved here from Amazon in Edinburgh where I lead a ML team in advertising. 

My core interests lie in:

- Building great engineering teams and creating launchpads for engineers 
- Building and Shipping software products that solve real world problems

In my spare time(like that's a thing) - I support Liverpool football club (YNWA!), headbang and play guitar(badly), travel the world with my wife (9 countries and counting), learn new languages (ola!), tinker with gadgets and read more than I can chew (Love [H2G2](https://goo.gl/zPtMwn) - title reference)
