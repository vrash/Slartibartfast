### Values I deeply care about
- Customer Obsession: I care deeply about going the extra mile for customers. Building products start and end with customers
- Empathy: Products are built by humans for humans (mostly). I care about empathy at every stage in that process. 
- Ownership: I like to own successes and failures passionately
- Clarity: I will strive for bringing clarity to everything. (You'll hear me say this word the most)
- Humility: I am confident but will always default to being humble 
- Learning: I am always looking to learn and at doing things better

### Who am I ? 
My name is Vrashabh Irde. Hi! :) 

I have 11 years of desktop/backend/mobile programming of which, 6+ years of managing other people like me. 
I've worked at small and large companies before, but I am really enjoying working with challenges that come with growing at scale. I've learnt more from failure (stint at ImagineK12 (Now a part of Y-Combinator)), than I have from success. But, I have found my calling in being an engineering leader of people for the last 6+ years.

I am currently the head of engineering at [carwow](www.carwow.co.uk), a tech startup in London. I moved here from Amazon in Edinburgh where I lead a ML team in advertising. 

My core interests lie in:

- Building great engineering teams and creating launchpads for engineers 
- Building and Shipping software products that solve real world problems

In my spare time(like that's a thing) - I support Liverpool football club (YNWA!), headbang and play guitar(badly), travel the world with my wife (9 countries and counting), learn new languages (ola!), tinker with gadgets and read more than I can chew (Love [H2G2](https://goo.gl/zPtMwn) - title reference)

### Cool things I've had a hand in building or my teams have built 
- Amazon ads on websites
- [Bankbazaar mobile apps](https://blog.bankbazaar.com/the-bankbazaar-mobile-app/)
