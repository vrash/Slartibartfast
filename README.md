### About me
The name is <b>Irde</b>. {Dramatic pause} <b>Vrashabh Irde</b>. :) 

I have close to 9 years of desktop/backend/mobile programming and about 4 years managing other people like me. I love competitive programming on platforms like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/slartibartfast), [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) and I am currently fighting bots on [Codefights](https://codefights.com/profile/slartibartfast). I love [organizing](https://blog.bankbazaar.com/hack-fun/) and participating in hackathons, and using my 20% time in companies to execute projects that improve engineering culture. 

I've worked at small and large companies before, but I am really enjoying working with challenges that come with growing at scale. I've learnt more from failure (stint at ImagineK12 (Now a part of Y-Combinator)), than I have from success (Oracle/Bosch/BankBazaar). 
But, I have found my calling in being an engineering leader of people for the last 4 years.

I currently work at a pre-unicorn fintech startup called [Bankbazaar.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BankBazaar), in Bangalore, India. Bankbazaar is funded by Amazon(amongst others) and we're building some exciting things on the [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bankbazaar.app&hl=en) and the [website](https://www.bankbazaar.com/) and I spearhead mobile engineering. With my team of fantastic engineers, we build the mobile apps (native apps/backend API's/infrastructure/automation) for Bankbazaar. A large part of my job involves keeping my team happy, focused, motivated and excited about the vision, by being a hands on engineering manager, and we've moved all the important metrics {Acquisition/Conversion} by 3 digit %'s.

My core interests lie in:

- Building and Shipping software products that solve real world problems
- Building great engineering teams and creating launchpads for engineers

In my spare time(like that's a thing) - I support Liverpool football club (YNWA!), headbang and play guitar(badly), travel the world with my wife (8 countries and counting), learn new languages (ola!), tinker with gadgets and read more than I can chew (Love [H2G2](https://goo.gl/zPtMwn) - title reference)
