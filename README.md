üëãüèº Hi, I'm Vrash, a technology executive and leader passionate about building inclusive, high-performing engineering and product organizations. I have 15+ years of software product building experience, 10+ years of managing awesome humans, and 4+ years of manager management experience. I love developing 0-1 playbooks for startups and scaleups and scaling up engineering organizations. I value customer obsession, empathy, integrity, radical transparency, and agency. I believe in the power of small, high-performing teams and the human side of building organizations and servant leadership. 

### Problem spaces I care about

I am a Co-creator of [Engineering leadership London](https://www.meetup.com/Engineering-leadership-Unconference/) meetup group which grows strong everyday, come join us!. I also used to mentor other engineering leaders on [Plato](https://community.platohq.com/mentors/vrashabh-irde) but I have currently paused this because Plato [deliberately](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/quit-mentoring-at-plato/) hides the fact that they are a network of unpaid volunteers, and I'd rather support folks directly.
