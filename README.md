I am passionate about engineering management. I am a Co-creator of [Engineering leadership London](https://www.meetup.com/Engineering-leadership-Unconference/) meetup group which grows strong everyday. I also mentor other engineering leaders on [Plato](https://community.platohq.com/mentors/vrashabh-irde)

### Values I deeply care about

- Customer Obsession: I care deeply about going the extra mile for customers. Building products start and end with customers
- Empathy: Products are built by humans for humans (mostly). I care about empathy at every stage in that process. 
- Ownership: I like my teams to own successes and failures passionately
- Clarity: I will strive for bringing clarity to everything. (You'll hear me say this word the most)
- Humility: I am confident but will always default to being painfully humble 
- Learning: I am always looking to learn and at doing things better
The best teams I managed cared about the same things. 

### Core Interests:

- Building great engineering teams and creating launchpads for engineers and engineering managers
- Building and Shipping software products that solve real world problems

In my spare time(like that's a thing) - I support Liverpool football club (YNWA!), headbang and play guitar(badly), travel the world with my wife (12 countries and counting), learn new languages (ola!), tinker with gadgets and read more than I can chew (Love [H2G2](https://goo.gl/zPtMwn) - title reference)
